# Machine Learning
Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! Here, I am actively practicing various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as part of my ML course practicals.

## Overview
This repository serves as a platform for exploring and implementing different Machine Learning algorithms. As I progress through my ML course, I aim to deepen my understanding of core concepts and techniques in the field of machine learning by applying them to real-world datasets and problems.

## What's Included
Algorithm Implementations: You'll find implementations of a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Practical Exercises: Each algorithm implementation is accompanied by practical exercises and examples. These exercises are designed to reinforce key concepts and demonstrate the application of algorithms to different datasets and problem domains.

### Datasets:
I include datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models. These datasets are sourced from various sources and cover a diverse range of domains such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences.
